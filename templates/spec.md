Every task has three fixed sub-lines. **Evidence** is where the requirement comes from (a MAP.md row or
section, an ARCHITECTURE.md section, a ledger id). **Verify** is a shell command run from the repo root whose
exit code is the verdict — `scripts/verify-spec.mjs` runs them all and decides `ship` or `fix`. **Owner** is
`builder` (writes code) or `verifier` (runs checks, read-only). A task that cannot be verified by a command is
not a task; it is a `manual_gates` entry with an owner and a date.

`$DASH` is the dev instance (`dev_server` in the front-matter, default `http://127.0.0.1:3105`); `$RUN` is the
`.agent-team/<run-id>` directory. Both are exported by `verify-spec.mjs`.
